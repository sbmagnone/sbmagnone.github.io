As a grant writing consultant, I build power for social justice movements by helping nonprofits identify and secure funding to fuel their work.

Before I entered the nonprofit world, I became a teacher and scholar of feminist literature because I believe in the power of stories to shape the contours of our world. Now, as a grant writer, I help social justice organizations tell their story to funders seeking to fuel transformative work.

A successful grant is a story that captivates its audience and compels them to take action, a channel that connects activists with the institutions who can support them. I’ll work with your team to articulate the importance of your mission, the power of your impact, and the immediacy of your need. Together, we’ll craft the stories that make your work legible and compelling to a range of potential funders.
