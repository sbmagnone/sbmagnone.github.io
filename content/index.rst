:status: hidden
:slug: index
:url: /
:save_as: ./index.html

.. Note that hidden doesn't mean inaccessible. It just means that it doesn't show up in any lists of pages. The "slug=index" parameter is a special signifier to mean that this content should go on the index page.

Some content goes here!!!!
