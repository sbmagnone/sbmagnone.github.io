    <p>Your team is hard at work changing the world—you don’t have spare time to spend hustling for grants. Building a successful grant proposal takes significant time, strong writing skills, and experience navigating the (often confusing) world of institutional fundraising. Guided by your team’s deep knowledge of your crucial mission work, I’ll manage the grant process so that you can focus on what’s most important: serving your communities and propelling change.</p>
<p>My services include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Researching funding opportunities &amp; identifying top prospects for your organization, including suggested funding level</li>
<li>Facilitating initial outreach to &amp; ongoing communications with funders</li>
<li>Gathering content &amp; background for grant proposals, letters of inquiry &amp; reports by talking to your team &amp; conducting external research as needed</li>
<li>Writing, editing, finalizing &amp; submitting grant materials</li>
<li>Managing grant logistics &amp; deadlines</li>
</ul>
